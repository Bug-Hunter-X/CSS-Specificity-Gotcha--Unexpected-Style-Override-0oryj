The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div p {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}
```

In this scenario, both selectors target the `<p>` element. However, the first selector (`div p`) is more specific because it targets a `<p>` element that is a direct child of a `<div>` element.  This leads to the blue color being applied instead of red, even though the second rule appears later.

The problem becomes more difficult to debug when there are multiple nested elements and numerous CSS rules.  The developer may not immediately understand the reason for the unexpected behavior.

This specificity issue can be a hidden bug, particularly in larger projects where multiple developers work on the CSS.
