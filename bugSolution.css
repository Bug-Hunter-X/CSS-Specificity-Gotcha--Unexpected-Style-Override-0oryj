The following CSS code demonstrates a solution to the specificity problem using the `!important` flag:

```css
div p {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red !important;
}
```

Using `!important` forces the `color: red` declaration to override the `color: blue` declaration, regardless of specificity.  However, overuse of `!important` is generally discouraged as it can make CSS harder to maintain and debug.  Refactoring the CSS to avoid specificity conflicts is always a better long-term solution.
